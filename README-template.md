This is a solution to the [Notiification homepage Quiz 2 challenge]

## Table of contents




## Overview
    I made a notification page with just HTML and CSS and could not add Jquery/Javascript due to limited time frame for the project.

## My process
I started with creating HTML and then the css. Since we had the html, I just edited and assigned classes to the names. I then used the class tags in the css and add the styling in the css.

### Built with

- HTML
- .Flexbox
- .Box
- Background attributes
- CSS display properties
- Flexbox
- CSS float



### What I learned

I learned different ways to position images in a box and also learned further about padding.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
`{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    text-decoration: none;
    list-style: none;

}`
`
.not {
    padding-top: 10px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;

}
`
.


### Continued development

The areas I want to focus on are wrapping everything in a box which I struggled, although I thought this was easier, it did not work for me. 
So, I will focus how to do that in  css next time.
